# odin_recipes

This my first individual project through Odin.

I am going to be creating a website of different cooking recipes with HTML 5.

Some of the skills that I will demonstrate with this project are:
- HTML 5 syntax and structure
- Creating headings, paragraphs, anchors, and images
- Organizing files efficiently
