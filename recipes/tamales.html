    <p>These are a great dish for birthdays, holidays, really all kinds of celebrations! They're a bit more complicated to make but definitely worth it!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs boneless chuck roast</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, 2 of them minced</li>
        <li>3 packages of dried corn husks</li>
        <li>4 dried ancho chiles</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tsp chopped oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>3 cups of lard</li>
        <li>9 cups masa harina</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Simmer boil beef and garlic in a large pot with water until beef is tender and shreds easily, about 3&frac12; hours.</li>
        <li>Remove beef from pot and reserve cooking liquid; shred beef with forks.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, soak corn husks in a large container with warm water.</li>
        <li>Toast ancho chiles in a cast iron skillet, remove stems and seeds. Crumble and grind with a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet; stir in flour and allow to brown slightly. Pour in 1 cup beef broth and stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Mix in ground chiles, minced garlic, oregano, cumin seeds, ground cumin, red pepper flakes, vinegar, and pinch of salt. Stir shredded beef into skillet and cover. Let simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place lard and salt in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add masa harina and beat on low speed until well mixed. Pour in reserved cooking liquid until mixture is the consistency of soft cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Drain water from husks. One at a time, flatten out each husk and spread about 2 tbsp of masa mixture on the broad end, about &frac23; up.</li>
        <li>Place about 1 tbsp of meat mixture down the middle of the masa.</li>
        <li>Fold the two long edges of the corn husk inward and then fold the flat point down to seal the contents of the husk.</li>
        <li>Place tamales in a steaming pot and steam for about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
